My Interest in IT started in Secondary school, hanging around the local Tandy shop, and spending time on the new TRS-80 Personal computers, reading cover to cover Personal Computer magazines, using and programming my Physics Teacher’s Hewlett Packard Programmable Calculator and purchasing the Latest Texas Instruments programmable calculator with magnetic strip storage & thermal printer! Later Summer school at Preston Institute of technology – learnt some programming of PDP11 & TRS-80 Colour Computers. My Physics Teacher arranged for me to gain some Work experience at ICI Computer Lab’s Main Frame Computers, where I performed task’s such as Feed Punch cards into hoppers, Change large magnetic tape reels, change 5MB Magnetic HDD Spindles, and helped monitor operations of Main frame Computer – which took up a whole floor of the building – also carted Magnetic Tape reels to the basement for backup storage! 

### Motivation for Studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through OUA
During Christmas – New Year of 2018-2019 – I felt calling of the Holy Spirit to Begin certification of my Technical Skills for future Missionary IT Support, and future Missionary Bible College Training. Via OUA – I decided that the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT was suitable for acquiring the necessary Qualifications! I have started with two Introductory subjects to determine if I will be able to manage the work load and commitment to gain these qualifications. I seek further multi-platform Small Business Administration skills, including Windows & Linux Server Installation, support, troubleshooting and administration, database and web design skills would be highly beneficial to future career!
